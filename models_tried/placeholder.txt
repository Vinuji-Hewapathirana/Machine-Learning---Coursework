This folder contains ipynb files of random forest classification models explored during the Machine Learning project for the coursework. 

Each model here represents different attempts tested to improve performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These models were developed using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique), classweights, hyperparameter tuning and feature reduction to address class imbalance and improve accuracy.
