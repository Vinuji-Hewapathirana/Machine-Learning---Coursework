This folder contains an ipynb file of another neural network model explored during the Machine Learning project for the coursework. 

The model here represents a different attempt tried to improve performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This model was developed using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to address class imbalance.
